<b>
Q: What is the difference between hypnosis and subliminal programming?	
</b>
<br>

<p><b>A:</b>Hypnosis is usually done by a hypnotherapist who is giving you suggestions that you can hear. With hypnosis you are put in a state of relaxation and you are guided.
The hypnotherapist talks to you and their voice offers deeply implanted suggestions. Hypnosis is proven to be every effective for most people.
Subliminal programming is similar except you do not hear the positive suggestions because they are delivered at a frequency below the level our ear hears at, thereby going directly into your brain without your conscious mind resisting the message.
Subliminal programming delivers a lot more repeated messages.
We offer hypnosis sessions that are prerecorded by a trained certified hypnotherapist.  We offer them for $24.99.  The usual price of a session with a hypnotherapist is usually $100 or more.</p>

Q: Will I really lose weight?
</b>
<br>
<p>
<b>A:</b>  Losing weight is a tough challenge that 95% of people fail at regularly. Yes you will lose weight. The human brain does not like unresolved issues so that when you feed it the positive messages, the brain works at resolving these issues. 	
The results is that people have seen their behavior change:
•	Their cravings drop way
•	They become more relaxed
•	They are more focused
•	They enjoy themselves more and the weight magically melts away
•	There is nothing more powerful than your mind
</p>
<b>
Q: What about diet and exercise?
</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b>  It is commonly known that diets don’t work. When you diet you are restricting yourself. Your body will accept this for a while until the time it has had enough, and then you lose all control and you binge. You gain back all the weight you lost and in many cases you even add more weight.
Rock N Lose will help you moderate your eating naturally to be including fruits, vegetables and whole grains and to naturally stop desiring the fast foods, the sweets, and the canned and processed foods that add fat into your diet.
We are writing a book called The 16 Hour a Day Water Diet:
Simply drink water for 16 hours a day and eat in an 8 hour window, let’s say 12 noon to 8pm and your body will detox, accelerate your weight loss and eliminate cravings. Fruits, vegetables and fresh squeezed juices are acceptable cheats for the time outside your eating window.
Concerning exercise: movement is good for your body to keep your blood flowing and your muscles working. Find exercises or sports you love. We will be producing a love to exercise subliminal program soon. This will help you to enjoy moving your body. Intense exercise including aerobics has not shown to take off much weight.

<b>
Q: How does it work?
</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b>  Once you download the app, the app will automatically be playing a silent subliminal track.  Subliminal means it is below your level of awareness.
In scientific terms the human ear starts to hear  at 20 hz ,  subliminal sounds are delivered from 1 hz to 19hz  therefore you do not hear any words at all, but your brain does receive it and integrates it. This has been proven in clinical studies to influence your behavior and choices. It has been documented that people get myouore relaxed, you are more focused. Your memory power increases, pain diminishes and people lose weight.
</p>
<b>
Q:  Is subliminal programming dangerous?
</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b>  Subliminal programming is safe. The messages you are receiving in our program are all positive. However this is a new branch of science and you should always trust your intuition.  If you feel uncomfortable you can turn off or slow down the subliminal soundtrack.
The human mind is very powerful and the full extent of its power has not been discovered or revealed. Everyone is different like each fingerprint is different.  Many people will have their brain affecting their chemistry almost immediately. These chemical changes will have positive effects on your body. Thousands of changes will be happening inside you before you even notice your weight dropping:  your breathing could be slower,  your eyes more alert, your hearing more acute, your blood flowing, and your kidneys releasing more. The transformation inside you can be going on from the moment you start using the program.

<b>
Q: Do you advertise products subliminally
</b>
<p>
A: No we operate with integrity.  There are no subliminal suggestions that suggest you should buy anything.
</p>
<b>
Q: What are the positive messages?
</b>
<br>
<p>
<b>A:</b> Here are a few of the types of messages that are in the subliminal programming:
•	“imagine yourself drinking water throughout the day”
•	“Imagine yourself eating a healthy meal”
•	“Imagine your weight dropping away like snow melting on a spring da
</p>
<b>
Q: How come you do not tell us positive messages?
</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b> We do not tell you the positive messages because we do not want your conscious mind to be objecting and interfering with them as they are being delivered to your brain.
</p> 

<b>
Q: What is the difference between the free and the premium program?
</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b>  The positive messages are the same in both programs. And both programs will produce results. The premium program has a fuller range of sound. It covers from 1 to 20 hz.  So with the premium program you get to hear all of the subliminal messages and sounds.
</p>
<b>
Q:  How long has subliminal programming been around?
</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b>  There are references in literature to Aristotle, the great Greek teacher (384–322 BC) using subliminal influences to affect people.  Dr. Sigmund Freud, The Father of Psychoanalysis, said that the mind is like an iceberg, 1/8 is above the water and the rest is your subconscious. 
Since the 1950s Madison Avenue advertising has been using visual subliminal suggestions, and there are about a dozen books written on this topic.

<b>
Q: Why should I use this program?  
</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b>  When personal computers first came out people were saying why should I use email.  The subliminal programs we offer will develop your mind and get you the things you want faster and easier.  Remember Neo in the movie The Matrix?  They were able to download skills directly into his brain.
Our patent pending programs will enable you to hear thousands of positive messages a day.  How much can you develop yourself if you had the focus, the clarity and if you could build your commitment?
The benefits could be beyond what you can imagine. How great could you become if you had no barriers? How fantastic could your life be if you had the vision, inspiration and passion?
</p>
<b>
Q: Do I need your headsets or can I use my own?
</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b>  You need to see what the manufacturers’ specs say about the frequency range.  We designed our own headset which we give you for free when you sign up for the premium package.  All of headsets we looked at began at 20 hz. Our headsets begin at 1 hz. Apple headsets begin at 5 hz which is good for subliminal programming.
</p>
<b>
Q:  What are binaural beats?
</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b>  Binaural beats are different sound signals delivered to each ear via headphones. Your brain meshes the two sounds into a single tone. This effect was discovered in 1839 by Heinrich Wilhelm Dove, a Prussian physicist and meteorologist.
</p>
<b>
Q: Why do you say sharing this with others is important for me?
</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b>  By sharing with others you are intending to help them. When you do that you are also helping yourself. When you share, you reinforce your commitment and you learn from the things you are saying.  Also you are engaging your mind in the process that you are looking to grow in.
</p>
<b>
Q: How long do I need to use the subliminal program?
</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b> The more you do it, the better results you will get. Even when you reach your desired weight you should continue to use our program so the weight stays off. We are introducing new programs on a regular basis on topics that are of interest to many people. You should consider trying some of them such as Money Magnet, the Law of Attraction, Anxiety Buster, Mind Fitness, and Instant Energy. Our goal is to have 100 programs available. Let us know what topic you are interested in.
</p>
<b>
Q: What devices can I use this on?
</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b>  Our tech team is working constantly to improve the subliminal programming that we use.  Initially we started with android phones, then iPhones, then PC’s, then tablets and iPads.  Our goal is to have our programs available for all platforms.  
</p>
<b>
Q: Do you really think subliminal programming can change my life?
</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b> Absolutely yes
</p>
<b>
Q: How long should I listen for?
</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b>  The more you listen the more positive messages you get.
Your normal internet activity probably takes 2-5 hours a day.
That will give you enough time to get the results you want.
As your desire grows, we have other programs or easily developing other skills
</p>
<b>
Q: What should I expect?
</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b>  You should expect to start seeing the results you want within days.
For some people it might take a month or longer. We are all different, but in some ways we are all the same. We have a mind, we have a brain and the subliminal thoughts will get thru to you.  There is nothing more powerful than your mind.
